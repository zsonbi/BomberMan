**Game:**\
The game takes place on a 2D grid composed of square tiles. Two players control one Bomberman character each, aiming to be the last one standing. The game board contains walls, boxes, monsters, and the players' characters. Players can place bombs to destroy boxes, monsters, and even each other (or themselves). A player loses if they are blown up or caught by a monster. The game consists of rounds which can be set when we begin. The winner is always the last player who stays standing, if everyone dies in a short amount of time the round ends in a draw. The players can choose skins and other modifiers such as battle royale for the game. It is possible to pause or save the game's current state and load it later.

**Walls:**\
	-Indestructible: It can't be destroyed and is also impassable, only the ghost monster and a player with a ghost bonus can pass through it\
 	-Destructible: It can be destroyed by players and also drops some kind of bonus (if it wasn't placed by a player)\
